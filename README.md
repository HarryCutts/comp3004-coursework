===================

This is the graphics demo I created for the Principles of Computer Graphics module at the University of Southampton in 2013/2014. The theme for that year was "The Clangers".

You can see a screen recording of the demo in action [on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/83759625). If you want to run it yourself, the instructions in [`handin/readme.txt`](handin/readme.txt) might help.

* the following textures:
